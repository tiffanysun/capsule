# What is Capsule? 
<br>
Capsule is an interactive installation that aims to challenge peopleâ€™s biases by connecting them with strangers in the same city. Capsule serves as an intermediary to help guide people in sharing experiences and memories.
<br>

At the end of the experience, the participants receive a scented fragrance which symbolizes the experience they had together. The end result is not only the interaction between the two people, but a shared moment that is encapsulated into a fragrance.


# How does Capsule work?

3 parts:
1. kinect to processing 
2. processing to log interactions 
3. processing to arduino to run the algorithm (to create a parametric perfume)
